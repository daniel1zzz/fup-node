# Fup Node Tester

This small utility allows you to generate the body of a file, for example, to use it in a query in **postman**, for example. It also allows you to directly make the request to the corresponding API.

`note:` if you use a browser such as **Brave** it may block some requests such as *local http*, you just have to deactivate the shield for the page.
